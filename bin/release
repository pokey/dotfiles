# Releases a new version of a library using `git flow`

# something like the following:
#
# PART=minor NEXT_VERSION=1.92.0 release
#
# TODO: Loop checking status of PR using `hub api` instead of waiting for ENTER;
# something like the following:
#
# hub api -XGET /repos/pokey/dotfiles/pulls/2 | jq '.mergeable'
# 
# TODO: Use -o on hub pr to open it automatically
# TODO: Add stages so that the command can safely be rerun when it fails in the
# middle.  Would define `stage` command and do something like:
#
# stage 1 && foo
#
# or
#
# if stage 1 ; then
#     foo
#     bar
# fi
#
# And then `stage` would both check if current stage is equal to expected, or
# is one less, and set stage to current stage if so.  If stage is greater, then
# skip, if it is unexpected value, then fail.  Stage will be stored in a
# .release-stage file and removed at the end
# TODO: Remove dependence on rg
# TODO: Add something to body of PR saying not to merge manually.
